<p>The scientific impact of a particular piece of research is reflected inhow this work is taken up by the scientific community. The firstsystematic approach that was used to assess impact, based on thetechnology available at the time, was to track citations and aggregatethem by journal. This strategy is not only no longer necessary — since nowwe can easily track citations for individual articles — but also, and moreimportantly, journal-based metrics are now considered a poor performancemeasure for individual articles [@Campbell2008; @Glanzel2013]. One majorproblem with journal-based metrics is the variation in citations perarticle, which means that a small percentage of articles can skew, andare responsible for, the majority of the journal-based citation impactfactor, as shown by Campbell [-@Campbell2008] for the 2004<italic>Nature</italic> Journal Impact Factor. <bold>Figure 1</bold> furtherillustrates this point, showing the wide distribution of citation countsbetween <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research articles published in 2010. <italic>PLOSBiology</italic> research articles published in 2010 have been cited a median 19times to date in Scopus, but 10% of them have been cited 50 or moretimes, and two articles [@Narendra:2010fw; @Dickson:2010ix] more than300 times. <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> metrics are used as examples throughout thisessay, and the dataset is available in the supporting information (<bold>DataS1</bold>). Similar data are available for an increasingnumber of other publications and organizations.</p>

<p>Scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not beadequately measured by any single indicator[@Glanzel2013; @bollenEtal2009; @Schekman2013].To this end, PLOS has collected and displayed a variety of metrics forall its articles since 2009. The array of different categorisedarticle-level metrics (ALMs) used and provided by PLOS as of August 2013are shown in <bold>Figure 2</bold>. In addition to citationsand usage statistics, i.e., how often an article has been viewed anddownloaded, PLOS also collects metrics about: how often an article hasbeen saved in online reference managers, such as Mendeley; how often anarticle has been discussed in its comments section online, and also inscience blogs or in social media; and how often an article has beenrecommended by other scientists. These additional metrics providevaluable information that we would miss if we only consider citations.Two important shortcomings of citation-based metrics are that (1) theytake years to accumulate and (2) citation analysis is not always thebest indicator of impact in more practical fields, such as clinicalmedicine [@VanEck2013]. Usage statistics often betterreflect the impact of work in more practical fields, and they alsosometimes better highlight articles of general interest (for example,the 2006 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> article on the citation advantage of Open Accessarticles [@Eysenbach2006], one of the 10 most-viewedarticles published in <italic>PLOS Biology</italic>).</p>

<p>A bubble chart showing all 2010 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> articles (<bold>Figure3</bold>) gives a good overview of the year’s views andcitations, plus it shows the influence that the article type (asindicated by dot color) has on an article’s performance as measured bythese metrics. The weekly <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> publication schedule isreflected in this figure, with articles published on the same daypresent in a vertical line. <bold>Figure 3</bold> also showsthat the two most highly cited 2010 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research articles arealso among the most viewed (indicated by the red arrows), but overallthere isn’t a strong correlation between citations and views. Themost-viewed article published in 2010 in <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> is an essay onDarwinian selection in robots [@Floreano2010]. Detailedusage statistics also allow speculatulation about the different waysthat readers access and make use of published literature; some articlesare browsed or read online due to general interest while others that aredownloaded (and perhaps also printed) may reflect the reader’s intentionto look at the data and results in detail and to return to the articlemore than once.</p>

<p>When readers first see an interesting article, their response is oftento view or download it. By contrast, a citation may be one of the lastoutcomes of their interest, occuring only about 1 in 300 times a PLOSpaper is viewed online. A lot of things happen in between thesepotential responses, ranging from discussions in comments, social media,and blogs, to bookmarking, to linking from websites. These activitiesare usually subsumed under the term "altmetrics," and their variety canbe overwhelming. Therefore, it helps to group them together intocategories, and several organizations, including PLOS, are using thecategory labels of Viewed, Cited, Saved, Discussed, and Recommended(<bold>Figures 2 and 4</bold>, see also [@Lin2013]).</p>

<p>All <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> articles are viewed and downloaded, and almost all ofthem (all research articles and nearly all front matter) will be citedsooner or later. Almost all of them will also be bookmarked in onlinereference managers, such as Mendeley, but the percentage of articlesthat are discussed online is much smaller. Some of these percentages aretime dependent; the use of social media discussion platforms, such asTwitter and Facebook for example, has increased in recent years (93% of<italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research articles published since June 2012 have beendiscussed on Twitter, and 63% mentioned on Facebook). These are thelocations where most of the online discussion around published articlescurrently seems to take place; the percentage of papers with comments onthe PLOS website or that have science blog posts written about them ismuch smaller. Not all of this online discussion is about researcharticles, and perhaps, not surprisingly, the most-tweeted PLOS articleoverall (with more than 1,100 tweets) is a <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> perspective onthe use of social media for scientists [@Bik2013].</p>
<p>Some metrics are not so much indicators of a broad online discussion,but rather focus on highlighting articles of particular interest. Forexample, science blogs allow a more detailed discussion of an article ascompared to comments or tweets, and journals themselves sometimes chooseto highlight a paper on their own blogs, allowing for a more digestibleexplanation of the science for the non-expert reader[@Fausto2012]. Coverage by other bloggers also servesthe same purpose; a good example of this is one recent post on theOpenHelix Blog [@Video2012] that contains video footageof the second author of a 2010 <italic>PLOS Biology</italic> article[@Dalloul2010] discussing the turkey genome.</p>
<p>F1000Prime, a commercial service of recommendations by expertscientists, was added to the PLOS Article-Level Metrics in August 2013.We now highlight on the PLOS website when any articles have received atleast one recommendation within F1000Prime. We also monitor when anarticle has been cited within the widely used modern-day onlineencyclopedia, Wikipedia. A good example of the latter is the Tasmaniandevil Wikipedia page [@Tasmanian2013] that links to a<italic>PLOS Biology</italic> research article published in 2010[@Nilsson2010]. While a F1000Prime recommendation is astrong endorsement from peer(s) in the scientific community, beingincluded in a Wikipedia page is akin to making it into a textbook aboutthe subject area and being read by a much wider audience that goesbeyond the scientific community.</p>
<p><italic>PLOS Biology</italic> is the PLOS journal with the highest percentage ofarticles recommended in F1000Prime and mentioned in Wikipedia, but thereis only partial overlap between the two groups of articles because theyfocus on different audiences (<bold>Figure 5</bold>). Theserecommendations and mentions in turn show correlations with othermetrics, but not simple ones; you can’t assume, for example, that highlycited articles are more likely to be recommended by F1000Prime, so itwill be interesting to monitor these trends now that we include thisinformation.</p>

<p>With the increasing availability of ALM data, there comes a growing needto provide tools that will allow the community to interrogate them. Agood first step for researchers, research administrators, and othersinterested in looking at the metrics of a larger set of PLOS articles isthe recently launched ALM Reports tool [@ALM2013]. Thereare also a growing number of service providers, including Altmetric.com[@Altmetric2013], ImpactStory [@Impactstory2013], and Plum Analytics[@Plum2013] that provide similar services for articlesfrom other publishers.</p>
<p>As article-level metrics become increasingly used by publishers,funders, universities, and researchers, one of the major challenges toovercome is ensuring that standards and best practices are widelyadopted and understood. The National Information Standards Organization(NISO) was recently awarded a grant by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation towork on this [@NISO2013], and PLOS is actively involvedin this project. We look forward to further developing our article-levelmetrics and to having them adopted by other publishers, which hopefullywill pave the way to their wide incorporation into research andresearcher assessments.</p>
