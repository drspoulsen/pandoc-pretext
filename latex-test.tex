This is the first paragarph, not in a section.

\section{Section 1}\label{sec-1}

Here is a paragraph inside section 1.  Here is some math $\int_1^2 \sin(x)\, dx$.

\subsection{A subsection}

This subsection contains a theorem:

\begin{theorem}
Statement of theorem
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This is the proof.  QED.
\end{proof}

\section*{A second, unnumbered section}\label{sec-2}

This section is shorter than \ref{sec_1}.  But it is a lot longer than \cite{test-cite}.

Here is a url: \url{https://github.com}.  What happens with that?
